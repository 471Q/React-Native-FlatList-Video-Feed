The Flatlist is optimized (if more optimization possible, please suggest!!!)
Features include:
1.	Render 1 video at a time
2.	Post Snap to next/prev video like TikTok
3.	Play/Pause on Tap
4.	Play video which is in visible view
5.	Stop video outside visible view
6.	Moving to previously seen video starts the video from the initial position
7.	Video loops on the end
