# React-Native-FlatList-Video-Feed
 This application uses updated InViewPort library to recreate TikTok video feed with all the features of the video player.
 
 The Flatlist is optimized (if more optimization possible, please suggest!!!)
 
 Features include:
 1. Render 1 video at a time
 2. Post Snap to next/prev video like tiktok
 3. Play/Pause on Tap
 4. Play video which is in visible view
 5. Stop video outside visile view
 6. Moving to previously seen video starts the video from inital position
 7. Video loops on end 

The purpose of creating this repository is to get feedback on how to optimize this solution furthur and as an example about how to achieve proper video feed in react-native.
